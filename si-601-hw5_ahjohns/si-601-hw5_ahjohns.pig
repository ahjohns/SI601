/*The Load functions was taken from the assignment write up.  Not sure how comments work in pig?
I was getting errors trying to get the first two steps on Hadoop, saying I can't write to a file. I know I have them completed, with the test work in Grunt. My code for this bonus assignment is below.

My counts also was shooting out an error in grunt; saying there was too many values.  Not sure if that was just a warning or if there was actually an error. If it was just a warning, then Step 3 should be done (but same writing files problem).

As far as Step 4,  I know that it is wrong, I grabbed the code from the assignment writeup, and am unsure if that's how it is supposed to look in pig.

But I think I used the STORE function correctly at the end? I would actually be interesting in seeing how Step 4 is actually done. 

Danny helped me figure out my approach in office hours.
Thanks Danny!!!!!

I think this is how you comment code in Pig?
